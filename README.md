# A React Project - Github User Finder App

 * In this project, I've tried to "mimic" the Search component of the Github for users.
 * Basically you are entering a string keyword to search and my app returns you the related users with their avatar image and their username. 
 * Then if you click one of the users, you can see the person's detailed information like how many followers does he/she have, num of repos, website / twitter info etc...
 * And the app also lists the most recent 10 repos of the user and you can click to open them in Github page.
 * [Feel free to look at here](https://dreamy-euclid-bed371.netlify.app/).
